<h5 id="steps-to-make-waiting-for-spring-sakura-swiss-roll-egg--and-dairy-free">Steps to make Waiting for Spring Sakura Swiss Roll (Egg- and Dairy-Free):</h5>
<ol>
<li>Refer to the Recipe &quot;The Cherry Blossoms Have Bloomed&quot; by user &quot;Minori105&quot;. Let the desalted sakura blossoms &quot;bloom&quot;. Finely chop 5-10 of the blossoms. -  - <a href="https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/142718-salt-cured-cherry-blossoms">https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/142718-salt-cured-cherry-blossoms</a></li>
<li>Soak the salted sakura leaves in water for about 30 minutes to desalt. Pat the leaves dry with a paper towel. Microwave the leaves for 60 seconds, then turn them over. Microwave for another 60 seconds. Once the leaves are crispy, finely crush them. (A small blender will be useful if available.)</li>
<li>Crush 1/3 of the frozen raspberries with your hands. Defrost them with the rest of the raspberries. Line a baking tray with parchment paper.</li>
<li>Roast the almond powder in a frying-pan until aromatic. Turn off the heat and let it cool down completely.</li>
<li>Combine the ☆ ingredients, and sift them in a bowl. Add the crushed sakura leaves and mix well.</li>
<li>Dissolve the red food colouring in the ★ cold water. Mix with the canola oil to emulsify.</li>
<li>Make a well in the centre of the dry ingredients. Add the mixture from Step 6 and well-chilled carbonated water, and fold them in. (Mix swiftly to prevent the gas in the carbonated water from escaping. Don't knead.)</li>
<li>When it's no longer floury, add the vinegar and gently fold it in. (The batter should appear white and starts to rise.) Pour the batter into the baking tray from Step 2. Smooth out the surface to spread the batter evenly to fill the corners.</li>
<li>Bake for 10-12 minutes at 170℃. （I use a gas oven, so if you use an electric oven, you may need to adjust the baking time and temperature. Bake for 3-5 minutes longer at 180℃, if necessary.)</li>
<li>Once it's baked, loosely wrap with plastic film to maintain the moisture. Let it cool down.</li>
<li>Whip the soy whipping cream over a bowl of ice water. Add the oligosaccharide sugar, lemon juice, and sakura liqueur, and continue to whip. Put 1/3 of the whipped cream into a pastry bag with a nozzle. Add the small pieces of crushed raspberries and chopped sakura blossoms into the remaining whipped cream, and mix.</li>
<li>Peel off the parchment paper under the cake, and place it back under the cake. Spread the cream with raspberries on the cake to 2-3 cm from the edge, leaving the margin for the end. To roll the cake easily, make 4 or 5 shallow cuts in 2 cm intervals starting from the front of the cake and moving toward the back.</li>
<li>Remove the moisture from the raspberries with a paper towel, and sprinkle them over the cream. Roll it tightly, away from you, while using the parchment paper under the cake. Once rolled, allow it to rest in the refrigerator for 2 hours.</li>
<li>Decorate the top with sakura cream and sakura blossoms, then it's done.</li>
