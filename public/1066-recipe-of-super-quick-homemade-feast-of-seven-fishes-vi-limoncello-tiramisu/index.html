<p>It's a great recipe for entertaining, given that you make the tomato base one day ahead. Another thing you need to know is that there is no traditional set of seven fishes to be used for this particular occasion. There are many different flavors of tiramisu such as strawberry, raspberry, and other berries, or nuts such as roasted almonds, pistachio, or hazelnut. There is no such thing as the &quot;Feast of the Seven Fishes&quot; in the Roman Catholic calendar. It's no surprise that those immigrants took their tradition of big, fishy Christmas Eve dinners with them, making it a popular Italian-American celebration today.</p>
