<p>You can make similar changes with the oils that you use to cook your food. For example, monounsaturated fat such as olive oil can help counter the bad cholesterol in your diet. Olive oil also is a good source of vitamin E which is beneficial for your skin, among other things. If you currently are consuming plenty of fresh fruits and veggies, you may want to think about where you&rsquo;re getting them and if it&rsquo;s the best source. If at all possible, go for organic produce that has not been sprayed with harmful chemical substances. You can be certain that you&rsquo;re getting the most nutritional benefits from your fresh produce if you can locate a local supplier because you will be able to get the fruit when it is the freshest and ripest. Hence, it should be somewhat obvious that it&rsquo;s not at all difficult to add healthy eating to your everyday life.</p>
