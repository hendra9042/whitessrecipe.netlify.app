<ol>
<li>Chop up vegetables (potatoes, butternut squash, carrots, onions, anything else you want to add) into small chunks.  -  - You want them to be thin enough to get oily and savory in the pan, and you want them to be fairly small pieces (but not tiny, except for the onions which you can dice up very small). Altogether you want roughly enough vegetables to cover the bottom of a medium-sized pan.</li>
<li>Coat a medium-sized pan in olive oil (or your preferred oil), add a bit of salt and pepper to the oil to taste.</li>
<li>Add the chopped vegetables into the pan and stir with a wooden spoon so that everything's nicely covered, then heat the pan with medium/medium-low heat with occasional stirring.  -  - When stirring, try not to break apart the potatoes or squash.</li>
<li>As the vegetables are cooking, prepare the egg batter:  -  - Grab a bowl and pour a small amount of heavy cream, maybe around one or two tablespoons.  -  - Then add shredded cheese (maybe half a cup or so—I use Mexican style but you can probably use whatever you like) and salt and pepper to taste.  -  - Finally, add in the 4 eggs and whisk everything together. It doesn't have to be perfectly smooth but you want the yolks and the cheese to be mixed in well. Put this bowl aside.</li>
<li>After the vegetables have cooked for about 10 or 15 minutes (or once the potatoes look nice and oily and the vegetables are starting to stick to the pan), remove from heat and drain oil.</li>
<li>Bring the pan (still with the vegetables but now with the oil drained away) back to heat and push the vegetables to the sides so there is a circle in the middle for the egg batter.</li>
<li>Pour in the egg batter, then after a few seconds start mixing everything together so that the vegetables are completely covered in egg batter.</li>
<li>Cook with occasional stirring until you can start scraping scrambled eggs off the sides and bottom of the pan. Continue doing so until all the eggs are cooked and scrambled and mixed with the vegetables.  -  - This should take about 5 minutes or less.</li>
<li>Remove from heat and serve! Add additional seasoning to taste if desired.</li>
