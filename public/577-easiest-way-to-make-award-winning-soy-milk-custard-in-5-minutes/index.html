<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-soy-milk-custard-in-5-minutes">The ingredients needed to make Soy Milk Custard in 5 Minutes:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Get  Banana (If you want to make it a rich, yellow egg-like color, try using 50 g boiled kabocha squash instead of the banana.)</li>
<li>Make ready  Soy milk</li>
<li>Take  Raw cane sugar (or beet sugar)</li>
<li>Take  Cake flour (or cornstarch)</li>
<li>Prepare  Vanilla oil</li>
<li>Make ready  Cream cheese, if desired (Can be omitted with no problem for those who don't use dairy products.)</li>
</ol>

<script type="text/javascript">

<h5 id="steps-to-make-soy-milk-custard-in-5-minutes">Steps to make Soy Milk Custard in 5 Minutes:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Mash the banana in a large bowl.  This time we're making banana custard, but you can omit the banana if you're making another kind of dessert.</li>
<li>Add in the cream cheese here, if using. Soften either at room temperature or for 30 seconds in the microwave first, and mix it in well.</li>
<li>Stir in the raw cane sugar, cake flour and vanilla oil, in that order.</li>
<li>Add the soy milk and continue mixing. (It's alright if there are a few lumps at this stage.)</li>
<li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and microwave for 2 minutes, until the edges are bubbling lightly.Take it out of the microwave and beat it well with a whisk.</li>
<li>Put it back in the microwave and heat for 1 minute. When the edges start bubbling again, take it out and mix well.</li>
<li>If it's not thick enough, put it back in the microwave and repeat the process of heating and mixing, for 30 seconds at a time. The photo shows a good thickness for things like cream-filled buns.</li>
<li>It's done when it reaches the thickness you desire. Spread it out in a shallow container, cover with plastic wrap and chill it in the fridge. You can also just cover the bowl as-is with plastic wrap.</li>
<li>To make on the stovetop: Steps 1-4 are the same. Then, transfer the mixture from the bowl to a pot and cook it over low heat, stirring continuously. When it's thickened to your liking, it's done!</li>
<li>This is what it looks like made with kabocha squash instead of banana. It looks and tastes like it's made with egg Macrobiotic recipes often use kabocha squash instead of eggs.</li>
<li>&quot;Caramel Banana Trifle&quot; made with custard, sliced bananas, whipped cream, nuts and topped with caramel sauce.</li>
<li>If you have custard left over, make custard toast. Just spread lots of custard on top of bread and toast it. It tastes just like cream-filled buns.</li>
