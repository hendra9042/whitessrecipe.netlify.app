<h5 id="instructions-to-make-crème-de-maple-maple-pudding">Instructions to make Crème De Maple (Maple Pudding):</h5>
<ol>
<li>Take the eggs out of the refrigerator and bring to room temperature before starting to make the pudding mixture.</li>
<li>Put all the A ingredients in a pan.  Cook over low heat stirring occasionally until the maple sugar dissolves completely. When the mixture reaches about 40-50 ℃, remove the pan from the heat.</li>
<li>Cool the mixture from Step 2 to about 30℃. If the mixture is too warm, the egg will form lumps.  Cooling the mixture too much is not good either.  Make sure to cool it to about 30℃.</li>
<li>Combine the egg yolk and the whole egg with a whisk taking care not to make it foamy. Tilt the bowl and move the whisk in straight lines as though you are &quot;cutting&quot; the egg white.</li>
<li>Gradually add the mixture from Step 3 into the Step 4 eggs stirring constantly with a whisk.  Once all the mixture is added, stir it well.</li>
<li>Strain the mixture from Step 5 through a fine strainer at least once . The egg white has small lumps which will change  the smoothness of the final product, so always strain the mixture.</li>
<li>Pour the Step 6 mixture into a heatproof container.  I strain the mixture into a measuring cup before adding it to a container.</li>
<li>Strain again from the measuring cup to the heatproof container.</li>
<li>This mini ramekin holds 55 ml of the mixture. (Ramekin size: 6 cm diameter x 5.8 cm height).</li>
<li>Cover the containers with aluminum foil.  * If the container has a lid, use it to cover the container.</li>
<li>Pour some boiling water into a baking tray, place the containers from Step 10 into it and steam bake in a 160℃ oven for 20 minutes.  Reduce the temperature to 140℃ and bake for another 25 minutes.</li>
<li>The cooking time varies by the size of the container and the oven that you are using.  For reference, the mini ramekins from Step 9 took 15 minutes at 160℃ and 13 minutes in 130℃.</li>
<li>I have explained how to steam bake in the oven here.  If you prefer to steam the pudding on the stove, refer to the &quot;Puko chan's recipe&quot;.</li>
<li>See my recipe blog for how to steam food in &quot;Staub Mini Round Cocotte&quot;. (Japanese only)</li>
<li>&quot;Once a film forms on the surface and the mixture does not fall apart when you tilt the container&quot; or &quot;the center of the pudding jiggles when you gently shake the container&quot; is the perfect time to remove it from the heat.</li>
<li>This is the perfect pudding described in Step 15.  This is fresh from oven and barely solid. It is very smooth and creamy.</li>
<li>This is the cross section. The texture is in between a thick cream and solid, but it is set. The bottom part has a creamier texture.</li>
<li>This is after refrigerating the pudding for 2 hours.  It is creamy, but has a much more solid texture than the texture of Step 17's pudding.</li>
<li>The heat of my electric oven is rather weak.  Check the state  after cooking for 15 minutes at 140℃. If the state is as shown in Steps 15 to 17,  the pudding is done.</li>
<li>If the pudding is not quite done, add more boiling water to the baking tray and bake it while checking every 5 minutes. If you are making this recipe for the first time, boil some water while baking the pudding.</li>
<li>Be careful to not overcook as wonderful texture will be ruined.  It may seem loose right out of the oven, but it will solidify while chilling.</li>
<li>Cool the pudding from Step 15 to room temperature.  Wrap tightly with plastic wrap and chill completely in the refrigerator.</li>
<li>Chill the pudding for more than 8 hours and it is done.  Drizzle on some maple syrup and enjoy.</li>
<li>My goal was to make a copy-cat recipe of the &quot;Appalaches Maple Pudding&quot; from the sweets store &quot;Le Chocolatier Takagi&quot;.</li>
<li>This is the &quot;Appalaches Maple Pudding&quot;.  This pudding is genius  It comes with maple syrup to pour on.</li>
<li>The pudding is topped with smooth and creamy crème Chantilly. It is super delicious and I love it. Now back to my recipe&hellip;</li>
<li>When the pudding from Step 22 is chilled for about 1-2 hours, add all the B ingredients in a bowl and beat until soft peaks form. Spread evenly onto the pudding.</li>
<li>Chill the pudding again for at least 5 hours.  I like the texture after chilling it overnight.</li>
<li>Look how perfect it is! It is delicious enough as it is, but you can drizzle  on some maple syrup for an even nicer touch.</li>
<li>This is the top layer. The hardened creme Chantilly, the pudding and the maple syrup are exquisite.</li>
<li>Next, you will encounter the smooth and creamy pudding layer. The maple syrup coats the pudding and melts in your mouth.</li>
<li>And then comes the even creamier pudding layer. It is almost a cream-like pudding that melts in your mouth.</li>
<li>And the bottom layer is a thick and smooth cream layer. It's great eating this luxurious custard cream.</li>
<li>These multiple textures give different enjoyments at each layer. Please enjoy this patisserie quality &quot;Crème de Maple&quot;.</li>
<li>See an easy standard custard pudding recipe that you can make with ingredients on hand at (Recipe ID 1868649): &quot;Mama's Melt-in-Your Mouth Custard Pudding&quot;.</li>
<li>This is an easy creamy pudding with gelatin, &quot;Café Mocha Pudding&quot;. -  - <a href="https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/150784-cafe-mocha-pudding">https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/150784-cafe-mocha-pudding</a></li>
