<ol>
<li>Begin by chopping the mushrooms, I normally slice them horizontally, it just looks better to well&hellip; see mushroom, shaped mushrooms, if you know what I mean.</li>
<li>Quarter the tomatoes and put them and the mushrooms into a bowl together for later.</li>
<li>Now peel the garlic, alternatively, you can just crush them, making removing the skin infinitely easier also this saves you having to crush it after you've peeled it (I'm an innovator I know) put the crushed skinless garlic into the same bowl as the tomatoes and mushrooms.</li>
<li>If you haven't yet cut the ginger into an inch piece, an inch thick? I really don't know how to measure out ginger sorry. Anyway, do it now! and slice the inch into the 3 big pieces or finely slice it, I don't really like eating ginger and I make big chunks so I know what to keep away. Now put it into the bowl from step 3</li>
<li>Chop the spring onions and put in a bowl save it for later.</li>
<li>If you bought beef chunks or have already cut the brisket into cubes ignore this, but if you haven't, do it now!!!</li>
<li>Now for the cooking to begin! Start by putting the beef into a cold pan, fill with cold water just enough to cover the meat by half an inch and bring to boil.</li>
<li>Once boiling, drain the water and all the gunky stuff that'll appear on the surface of the water.</li>
<li>Fill the pan back up with cold water and repeat step 7 and 8.</li>
<li>Now for the actual soup. You may need a bigger pan or pot then you used to boil the beef, who knows. I don't know what pan you're using. Anyway in a big pot put in your beef fill with 1.5 litres of water. Throw in the tomato, mushroom, garlic, and ginger from earlier. You can also add the mirin, soy sauce, chicken powder, white pepper, and the gochujang if you want it spicy if someone you're serving doesn't like the heat just put it into individual bowls later.

<li>Once boiling you can add the eggs just to boil for however long you want them(I like them hard-boiled). I'm not saying how long to boil an egg for it's basic you should already know.</li>
<li>When the eggs are ready take them out and put into ice water to stop cooking further.</li>
<li>After removing the eggs, turn the heat down and simmer for around 1-3 hours, it all depends on how big or small you cut the beef, take a piece out and try it to see how tender it is. Also, crush the tomatoes into the soup they should be soft enough now and release that flavour.</li>

Finish it off with the spring onions and the egg sliced in half. (Optional: This is the last point you can add the gochujang as well to whoever wants to bring the heat!) This recipe was a lot longer then I thought I'm sorry but if you stayed with me until the end then I hope you enjoy it!</li>
