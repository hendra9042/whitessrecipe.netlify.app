<li>Use room temperature eggs.</li>
<li>Stir ingredients A under low heat.  Mix well until the granulated sugar melts completely. Once the liquid is warm to the touch (approx. 40-50℃) remove from heat.</li>
<li>Cool the liquid from Step 2 until it reaches a temperature of around 30℃. If the liquid is too warm the eggs will cook. If it is too cold it is not good either. Always make sure the temperature is around 30℃.</li>
<li>Mix the eggs well without whipping them. Tilt the bowl and cut into the egg whites with a linear hand movement.</li>
<li>Pour liquid from Step 3 gradually into the eggs from Step 4 as you continue to whisk.  Once they are combined, mix well.</li>
<li>Strain the combined liquid from Step 5 through a fine mesh sieve or a tea strainer at least once. There will be small lumps from the egg whites. Make sure to strain these as it will make a difference in the smoothness of the pudding.</li>
<li>I use a tea strainer to strain the liquid from Step 6 into a measuring cup first. Then I am ready to transfer this into a heatproof pudding mold.</li>
<li>The small ramekin pictured here has a (6 cm diameter x 5.8 cm height) 55 ml capacity.</li>
<li>I strain the liquid from Step 7 into the ramekin using a tea strainer.</li>
<li>Place an aluminum lid over the ramekins. If your ramekins come with lids, use them instead of the foil.</li>
<li>Pour hot water in the baking pan and place the ramekins and steam bake in a 160℃ preheated oven for 20 minutes. Then lower the temperature down to 140℃ and continue for another 27 minutes.</li>

<li>If the skin forms on the top and the center of the pudding jiggles when gently shaken, it is done.</li>
<li>This is how a freshly made pudding will look. It is barely solid.</li>
<li>Our electric oven is rather weak in power.  Try steam baking at 140℃ for 15 minutes first and then check for doneness. If it looks like Step 15-16, it should be fine.</li>
<li>If you need to continue steam baking add more hot water onto the baking pan and monitor every 5 minutes. Use hot water when you steam bake initially.</li>
<li>Over cooking will ruin the texture of the pudding. Freshly baked pudding may be loose but when cooled it will solidify.</li>
<li>Cool the pudding down to room temperature then wrap firmly and cool in the refrigerator.</li>
<li>While waiting for the pudding to cool down, make the caramel sauce following steps fromand cool it in the refrigerator. -  - <a href="https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/145037-golden-caramel-sauce">https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/145037-golden-caramel-sauce</a></li>
<li>Cool the pudding in the refrigerator for 8 hours or more and you are done Top the pudding with caramel sauce and any other toppings of your choice.</li>
<li>The caramel sauce coated smooth creamy custard pudding tastes just like the pudding my mom used to make.</li>
<li>The surface is very smooth. A little further into the pudding and it is creamier and jiggly.</li>
<li>Even if you dig deeper with your spoon, it stays smooth and soft! It melts in your mouth.</li>
<li>It is a light delicious pudding made from whole eggs and milk. Try this &quot;Melting custard pudding&quot; made from simple ingredients.</li>
