<ol>
<li>Cut up the cucumber into thin strips and set aside. Then, heat up a skillet with the vinegar and water on high heat. As soon as it starts bubbling, add the salt and sugar and take it off of the heat. Pour the liquid onto the sliced cucumber into a heat-safe dish and let it pickle for at least 30 mins or 24 hours for the best results.</li>
<li>After you place the cucumber into the fridge, measure out the rice then rinse 2-3x until it runs clear.

After the peppers cook for a little bit, transfer them into a heat-safe bowl.</li>
<li>I wasn't too worried about the residue from the peppers when using the skillet again to cook the eggs.
