<li>Once boiling add your roast. Should not be completely covered where braising not boiling the meat.</li>
<li>Put the lid on and reduce heat to low.</li>
<li>All appliances very. 6 clicks for me out of 25 clicks being the highest. So pretty low after 20 mins or so take listen to your pot watch not to burn your ear should hear a nice slow simmer.</li>
<li>Set timer for one hour.</li>
<li>In the meantime chop up mushrooms and fresh parsley. Okay timer is beeping.</li>
<li>Add mushrooms and parsley and stir well to incorporate. Also at this time check your flavor profile. Mine was great. Something I've also learned over the course of some time to have your spouse or someone other then you give it a taste because you've been tasting and cooking this throughout and your palate can become neutralized to the flavors. Sometimes especially when smoking meat you rather have a different meal all together and eat the leftovers the next day while your guests enjoy day of&hellip;</li>
<li>This time crack lid and set timer to another hour.</li>
<li>Okay looks great smells wonderful whole building already knows what I am making.</li>
<li>Now get a fork and insert it into the center of roast and twist if you can twist freely and the meat will break apart easily your ready to go if not as in my case. crack lid add another 30 mins. And repeat as necessary untill tender.</li>
<li>Start water and cook noodles to your desired tenderness. Another nice little tip start your water on med heat. Heat 20 mins prior to cooking so when your ready to go and your meat or what ever your cooking is ready turn to high heat and you'll have boiling water in no time at all.</li>
<li>And there you have it easy and always incredible and tender beef. Serve with bread for dipping. Noodle or mash. Hope you all truly enjoy this proven recipe my family has been making this 80+ years!!!</li>
<li>All life and cultures are precious!!! Try to be nice to your fellow human beings!!! And that's no wall hanger fully functional!!</li>
<li>The leftover thing can happen I know this to be true. After 12+ hours of smelling and tasting your like give me a burger and pass the salad LOL not always&hellip; Building party!!!</li>
<li>May God be so kind to bless us all!!!</li>

<p>In a large Dutch oven, heat oil over moderately high heat. Serve braised beef with onions and sauce. I wanted it to be an easy one pot meal. This turned out very very flavorful. Pot roast was a one-pot wonder long before that was a term for homey dishes that are both Coating the beef in a little flour and browning it in the same pot used later for braising gives us lots of lovely It is often served over buttered egg noodles, or you can really gild the comfort-food lily and serve the.</p>
