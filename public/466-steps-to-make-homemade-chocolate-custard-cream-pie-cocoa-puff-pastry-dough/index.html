<ol>
<li>My Youtube Recipe Channel→What Santa left behind - Please come to see！</li>
<li>【For Cocoa Puff Pastry】 Mix cocoa and powdered sugar while crushing lumps. Put bread flour, cake flour, and salt in a bowl. (70g bread flour and 70g cake flour can be replaced with 140g all-purpose flour.) Add the cocoa sugar mixture to the flour, stir well, set aside.</li>
<li>Dice unsalted butter into about 5mm (0.2-inch). You should prepare well-chilled butter. Put diced butter into a large bowl. Add the flour mixture to the diced butter.</li>
<li>Toss to coat the cubed butter with flour. Crush and rub the cubes while mixing. Use a scraper in the second half to mix while cutting to prevent the butter from melting by the heat from your fingers. Mix it until the color becomes about evenly.</li>
<li>Pour half of the water over like drawing circles, mix roughly. You should prepare well-chilled water. Pour the remaining water, and mix roughly.</li>
<li>Put onto plastic wrap. Press lightly to a single mass. Flatten it and shape it square, wrap it with plastic wrap. It has some unevenness at this stage. Let it sit in a fridge for 3 hours (If possible, overnight).</li>
<li>【For Chocolate Custard Cream】 Break the chocolate into small pieces and add 3Tbsp milk to it. Microwave it at 500W for 1 min, and mix well to melt the chocolate. Sift cocoa powder with a tea strainer over the chocolate milk. Stir it until smooth. Set aside.</li>
<li>Put egg yolks and sugar in a bowl, mix with a whisk for 1.5 mins until heavy and whitish.</li>
<li>Sift cake flour over the egg mixture, and mix lightly until combined. Add vanilla oil, stir well. Add the milk in 4 parts. Stir well each time.</li>
<li>Microwave it at 500W for 1 min and mix it well. Repeat that 4 times until heavy and creamy. Please mix well each time. It should get heavy and creamy at the 4th time.</li>
<li>Strain the chocolate milk over the custard, and stir well. Microwave it at 500W for 30 sec and mix it well. Repeat that twice.</li>
<li>Put the hot chocolate custard in a flat container, cover it with plastic wrap, and put ice packs or ice on to cool down quickly. After cooling down, let it sit in a fridge.</li>
<li>【Fold the puff pastry dough.】 Take the dough out of the fridge. If your dough is hard, please leave it for about 10 mins at room temperature to soften a little. Flour your work surface, dough, and rolling pin. Roll out into a long rectangle of 5-7mm (0.2-0.3'') thick, while coating it lightly with bread flour. Fold the top third of the pastry down, then the bottom third up.</li>
<li>Rotate the dough 90 degrees. Roll out and tri-fold it again. Wrap it with plastic wrap and chill it for 30 mins. (If the dough becomes soft on the way, please cool it once.)</li>
<li>Repeat this whole process two more times (roll, tri-fold, 90℃ rotate, roll, tri-fold, chill). The dough will get smooth gradually.</li>
<li>【For Assembling】 Divide the dough into 6 parts. Roll each into 12 cm / 4.7'' square (3mm / 0.1'' thick) while coating it lightly with flour. Let it sit in a freezer for 20 mins. Preheat an oven to 220℃ / 428F.</li>
<li>Cut 6 sheets into a square 10cm x 10cm (3.9'' x 3.9&quot;). Fold it in half so the bottom point meets the top point. Make two incisions in it, 1cm in from the outside, in a diamond shape, but make sure they do not meet at the top.</li>
<li>Open the pastry, brush lightly the inside of incisions with water. Fold the left diamond to the right and the right diamond to the left to make a smaller diamond in the center and two points coming out of either side.</li>
<li>Prick holes in the bottom(center diamond) with a fork. Bake it at 200℃ / 392 F for 18 mins, 160℃ / 320 F for 5 mins. After baking, press each bottom lightly. Let it cool on a rack.</li>
<li>Take the chocolate custard out of the fridge. Mix lightly until smooth, and put into each pie. Sprinkle a pinch of cocoa over each cream. It's all done!!</li>
<li>I made stick pies with the remaining puff pastry, bake 200℃ / 392 F for 15 mins, and dip them into the remaining chocolate cream. It's delicious too!</li>
