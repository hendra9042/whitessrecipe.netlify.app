<li>The day before: Make the tart dough referring to. Let chill in the fridge overnight.</li>
<li>Make the peach compote referring tousing white wine. Let sit overnight. -  - <a href="https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/149490-peach-compote">https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/149490-peach-compote</a></li>
<li>Tart crust dough: Put the chilled tart dough on a sheet  of parchment paper. Lay another sheet on top and tap lightly with a rolling pin to soften it.</li>
<li>When it's soft enough, roll it out to a thickness of 3 mm.</li>
<li>Cut out circles of dough 2 cm larger than the molds. This time I used tart rings. The dough tends to stick to the parchment paper as it gets warm, so chill  the dough in the fridge after cutting out the circles.</li>
<li>When the dough firms up a bit and is easier to handle, peel it off the parchment paper and put it in the molds. Gently press it in by pinching it with your thumb and forefinger.</li>
<li>If using tart rings, the dough on the bottom will stick, so put it in on top of parchment paper. If the molds you're using tend to stick, grease them first.</li>
<li>Roll a rolling pin over the tops of the tart molds to cut off the excess dough. Pinch the edges again and lift the crust up a bit so it's a little higher than the edges of the molds.</li>
<li>Cover with plastic wrap and chill in the fridge for 1 hour (this prevents it from shrinking when baked).</li>
<li>Next, make the custard. Put the milk in a saucepan, scrape in the vanilla seeds, add the pod as well and heat until it's nearly boiling.</li>
<li>*If using vanilla bean paste, follow the same procedure.</li>
<li>Put the egg yolks in a bowl, add the sugar and beat well with a whisk until the mixture is white and thick. Sift in the cake flour and cornstarch and mix until well combined.</li>
<li>Take out the vanilla pod from the heated milk in Step 10. Pour the milk into the egg yolk mixture in Step 12 a little at a time.</li>
<li>Strain the mixture in Step 13 into a saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring constantly to keep it from burning.</li>
<li>Keep cooking and stirring until it has thickened.</li>
<li>If it looks like the top photo, and just drips  when dropped from a whisk, it's not nearly ready. When it looks like the bottom photo and drops in thick dollops, it's done.</li>
<li>When it becomes thick and smooth, remove from the heat immediately and mix in the rum. Spread it into a shallow container,and smooth the surface. It will become a bit firmer when chilled.</li>
<li>Cover with plastic wrap to prevent it from drying out, put gel ice pads on top and under it to cool it down quickly, then chill in the refrigerator.</li>
<li>Finish making the tart crusts. Lay parchment paper on top of the chilled tart crusts and put  pie weights on it. Be sure to use these to keep the tart crust from puffing up.</li>
<li>Preheat the oven to 180 ℃, then turn down the temperature to 170 ℃ and bake for 25-30 minutes. When the edges start to turn brown,about halfway through,take the tarts out  and carefully remove the pie weights.</li>
<li>*The edges will turn brown 15 minutes after baking. Return the pan to the oven and bake until the bottoms are browned as well.</li>
<li>After baking, cool slightly and brush with egg white (not listed). Bake again for 5 minutes at 140 ℃ to dry them out.</li>
<li>*Use the egg whites left over from the custard to brush on the tarts. This makes a protective coating,and keeps the filling from soaking into the crust.</li>
<li>Let cool completely after baking and carefully take them out of the molds.</li>
<li>Make the filling. Bring the  cream cheese to room temperature and knead with a spatula until soft.</li>
<li>*If you heat it in the microwave, it'll become too soft, so soften it by leaving it at room temperature for a while.</li>
<li>Knead the chilled custard with a spatula until smooth, as well.</li>
<li>Stir the custard and cream cheese from Step 25 together just until evenly blended. Don't over-mix, or it won't have a nice, smooth texture.</li>
<li>Put the mixture in a pastry bag with a plain tip and pipe a generous amount into the cooled tart shells. Pipe any leftovers in mounds in the middle of the tarts.</li>
<li>Place the drained peach compote on top of the tarts (the peaches are cut in half).</li>
<li>Brush the tops with nappage and sprinkle the edges with powdered sugar. You can do this nicely by covering the peach with a round piece of parchment paper and sprinkling the sugar. Lastly, garnish with mint leaves.</li>
<li>Chill in the refrigerator before serving. Try to eat the tarts the same day they're made while the crust is still crisp.</li>
<li>This recipe is really delicious, so I highly recommend it. Making the tart crust is a bit of a bother, though.</li>
