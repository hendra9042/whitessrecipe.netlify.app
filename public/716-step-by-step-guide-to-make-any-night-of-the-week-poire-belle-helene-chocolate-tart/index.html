<h5 id="steps-to-make-poire-belle-hélène-chocolate-tart">Steps to make Poire Belle Hélène Chocolate Tart:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Prepare the poached pears.  -  - In a sauce pot over medium heat, add water, sugar, cinnamon, star anise, cloves, lemongrass, liqueur, orange zest and ginger.  -  - Stir to combine well and until the sugar has dissolved. Stir, stir, stir.  -  - Turn the heat down to low and simmer for about 30 mins.</li>
<li>Remove from heat.  -  - Peel the pears using a peeler. -  - <em>I am using Belgian Conference Pears. They are sweet and seedless. You can use other types of pears, Bosc works well too. Except for Chinese pears.</em> -  - Using a melon baller, carefully remove the bottom of the pears.</li>
<li>If you are using pears like Bosc, you will need to scrape out all the seeds with a small sharp knife. Do it carefully and not damage the pears. -  - Place the pears immediately into the syrup or it will oxidize very quickly.  -  - Fill the pot with more water, just enuff to submerge the pears and only if necessary.</li>
<li>Return the pot back onto the heat.  -  - Cut out a round parchment paper to cover the pears and the syrup.  -  - This will ensure even coloring of the pears.  -  - Bring it up to a simmer and turn the heat down to low.  -  - Cover and poach the pears for 20 to 30 mins.  -  - Remove from heat and let chill in the fridge overnight, with the parchment paper still in tact.</li>
<li>Prepare the tart. -  - <em>You can skip this if you are using ramekins or without any tart shell.</em> -  - Preheat oven to 180 degree celsius or 360 fahrenheit.  -  - In a large bowl, cream butter until light and fluffy with a hand or stand mixer. -  - Add in sugar and continue creaming until combined well.</li>
<li>Add in cocoa powder, salt and almond flour. Mix until well combined. -  - Add in egg and mix until fully incorporated. -  - Lastly, fold in flour in 1/3 portions until everything is well combined. -  - <em>Do not overmix.</em> -  - Transfer onto a cling film. -  - Wrap and chill in the fridge for at least 2 hrs or best overnight, to firm up.</li>
<li>Transfer the dough onto parchment paper. -  - Place another parchment paper on top and roll into 1/4 inch thick. -  - Cut out circles larger than your pastry rings. -  - Swiftly, transfer the discs into the greased pastry rings. -  - Using your finger to lightly press and shape.</li>
<li>Trim off any excess with a sharp knife. -  - <em>You can reroll the leftover cookie dough. You can also freeze any leftover dough.</em> -  - Transfer the tart shells onto a baking tray line with parchment paper. -  - Wack into the oven and bake for 15 mins. -  - Remove from the oven and as quickly as you can, remove the pastry rings. -  - <em>Once the tarts are cool enuff to handle, you can use a microplane to trim off any rough surface around the brim.</em></li>
<li>Prepare the lava cakes.  -  - Preheat oven to 230 degree celsius or 450 fahrenheit.  -  - On a double boiler, add chocolate.  -  - Once the chocolate starts to melt, remove from heat and add butter.  -  - Stir until well combined and the butter has melted as well.  -  - Add in salt, Cointreau and orange zest.</li>
<li>Mix until well combined and set aside.  -  - In another bowl, add egg and sugar.  -  - Whisk to combine well.  -  - Add 1/3 of the warm chocolate mixture into the egg mixture. -  - Whisk until everything is fully incorporated.  -  - Transfer back into the chocolate mixture. -  - Fold until well combined.</li>
<li>Fold in the corn flour until everything is fully incorporated. -  - If you are using ramekins, transfer the chocolate batter into ramekins to about 3/4 full. -  - <em>Do take note that you will not be able to unmold the cakes.</em> -  - If you would like to serve these on a serving plate without the tart shell, lightly grease a pastry ring with some butter and wrap the inner circumference with parchment paper. Place the pastry ring on the serving plate and pour the batter into the ring.</li>
<li>If you are using the tart shells, pour in the chocolate batter. -  - Wack into the oven and bake for 8 mins.  -  - The edge should be hard while the middle is still soft and jiggly.  -  - Drain pears from the syrup.  -  - <em>You can make excellent tea with the syrup.</em></li>
<li>Place 1 pear into each ramekin, pastry ring, or tart shell. -  - There will be cracks and that's the beauty of this dish. -  - Wack back into the oven and bake for a further 5 mins.  -  - Remove from oven.</li>
<li>Plating.  -  - Garnish with some cacao nibs and mint on the sides  -  - Sprinkle some gold dust over the top.  -  - Serve immediately while they are still warm.</li>
<li>The best part is, you can prep the poached pears and tart shell in advance. -  - And I was inspired by the great Massimo Bottura and this happened: Oops, I dropped my chocolate tart.</li>
<li>Detailed recipe coming soon.</li>
